# clj-thymeleaf

A Ring integration of the Thymeleaf templating engine

## Usage

Place your templates in a typical Ring application folder structure (lein new compojure-app ...) under resources/public, use a .html extension.
Integration with Ring might look like the code given in clj-thymeleaf.samples.handler

The backend delivers data using the normal ring mechanism.

See https://github.com/plakat/clj-thymeleaf-sample for example code
